# readMe-Generator
WHEN the readME generator is used, the user should be prompted to enter information regarding their project.
THEN once the prompts have been submitted, the terminal will create a detailed format with a read me generator. The prompts will be asked as followed:

 
    message: "What is the GitHub user name?",
    name: "username"
  
    message: "email address?",
    name: "email"

    message: "Project's title?",
    name: "title"

    message: "Description of the project.",
    name: "description"

    message: "Does your project have a license?",
    name: "license",
    choices: 
        "MIT",
        "Unlicense",
        "Apache 2.0",
